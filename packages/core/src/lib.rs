// Note: If the operating system can’t create a thread
// because there aren’t enough system resources,
// thread::spawn will panic.
// That will cause our whole server to panic,
// even though the creation of some threads might succeed.
// For simplicity’s sake, this behavior is fine,
// but in a production thread pool implementation,
// you’d likely want to use std::thread::Builder
// and its spawn method that returns Result instead
